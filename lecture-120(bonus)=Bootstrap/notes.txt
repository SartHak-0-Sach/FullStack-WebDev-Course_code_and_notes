Bootstrap is a component based website building tool that helps us provide responsive, search engine optimised and beginner friendly websites.

When we put the CDN link of bootstrap in our HTML, it renders CSS that it gets for our program from a web URL. 

The benefit of using bootstrap is that we can directly copy the code and put pre-made components into our code designed by professional programmers who made the bootstrap website.

This is a very easy to do method of making good looking websites in small time.

The best part is all the components are customizable according to use.
